# astral-editor

Experimental JS toy that watches a text area for angle brackets
and converts the tags into 'italics' (actually Unicode astral-plane characters) as you type

Hit angle bracket twice to enter a true angle bracket.

I was playing with the idea that a drastically simplified HTML with only inline tags might be a good enough markup language for writers.
